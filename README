shrt

This is a URL shortener. There are many like it, but this is mine. Try
putting all the vowels in "shrt" and enjoy yourself!

Also handles go-get redirects.

There's no UI to add a new shortlink at this time. Just edit the DB by
hand.

Shrt is a CGI script, so it expect certain environment variables to be
defined when envoked. See RFC3875 for the CGI specification. See the
script files in the test subdirectory for simple use cases.

Shrt is customizable. Just modify the values in config.h to suit your
needs and rebuild.

Note that shrt expects its data file to be relative to the current
directory.
